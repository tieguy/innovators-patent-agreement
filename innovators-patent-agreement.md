### INNOVATOR’S PATENT AGREEMENT (IPA), Version 1.0

This innovator's patent agreement is dated [DATE], and is between the person(s) named below (collectively referred to as “Inventors”) and [COMPANY NAME], a [STATE OF INCORPORATION] corporation (“Company”).

The Inventors have invented certain patentable subject matter, and they want to assign these inventions to the Company.

The parties therefore agree as follows:

1.  Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Inventors hereby sell, assign, and transfer and have sold, assigned, and transferred to the Company, for itself and its successors, transferees, and assignees, the entire worldwide right, title, and interest in and to the following patent application(s):
    
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>Title</td>
        <td>Application No.</td>
        <td>Filed on</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
        <td></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    including: 
    
    (a) each invention and improvement (“Subject Matter”) disclosed therein; 
    
    (b) all right of priority in the above application(s) and in any underlying provisional or foreign application; 
    
    (c) all provisional, utility, divisional, continuation, substitute, renewal, reissue, and other applications related thereto which have been or may be filed in the United States or elsewhere in the world; and 
    
    (d) all patents (“Patents”), including reissues and reexaminations, which may be granted on any of the above applications, together with all rights to recover damages for infringement, including infringement of provisional rights.

2.  The Company, and its successors, transferees, and assignees (collectively the “Assignee”), shall not assert any claims of any Patents which may be granted on any of the above applications unless asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims of the Patents is for a “Defensive Purpose” if the claims are asserted: 

    (a) against an Entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Assignee or any of Assignee’s users, affiliates, customers, suppliers, or distributors;

    (b) against an Entity that has filed, maintained, or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against another in the past ten years, so long as the Entity has not instituted the patent infringement lawsuit defensively in response to a patent litigation threat against the Entity; or

    (c) otherwise to deter a patent litigation threat against Assignee or Assignee’s users, affiliates, customers, suppliers, or distributors.

    If Assignee needs to assert any of the Patent claims against any Entity for other than a Defensive Purpose, Assignee must obtain prior written permission from all of the Inventors without additional consideration or threat. 

    “Entity” means an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, association, joint venture, trust, unincorporated organization, or other entity.  “Affiliate” means with respect to any Entity, any other Entity, whether or not existing on the date of this agreement, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with that Entity. “Control” (including with correlative meaning the terms “controlled by” and “under common control with”), as used with respect to any Entity, means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction or management and policies of that Entity, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract, or otherwise. 

    Assignee acknowledges that the above promises are intended to run with the Patents and are binding on any future owner, assignee or exclusive licensee who has been given the right to enforce any claims of the Patents against third parties. Assignee shall not assign or transfer any right, title, or interest in the Patents without obligating the assignee or transferee to be bound by the provisions of this Section 2. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 2 will be void.   

3.  Assignee may apply for and receive patents for Subject Matter in Assignee’s own name. Inventors shall, when requested, and without further consideration, execute all papers necessary to fully secure to Assignee the rights, titles, and interests conveyed by this agreement. Inventors represent (a) that Inventors have the rights, titles, and interests to convey as set forth herein; and (b) that Inventors have not made any assignment, grant, mortgage, license, or other agreement affecting the rights, titles, and interests herein conveyed, except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement. Inventors shall not make any such assignment, grant, mortgage, license, or other agreement affecting the rights, titles, and interests herein conveyed, except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement.

4.  The Assignee hereby grants to the Inventors a limited perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, no-charge, irrevocable license under the Patents to exercise only those rights necessary to enforce the promises made by Assignee in Section 2. Accordingly, if Assignee asserts any of the Patent claims against any entity in a manner that breaks the promises of section 2, the Inventors, individually or jointly, may grant written nonexclusive sublicenses, without the right to further sublicense, the scope of the sublicense being limited to those rights necessary to enforce the promises made by Assignee in Section 2.  

    Any sublicense granted by the Inventors under this section must be without threat or additional consideration; otherwise, the sublicense will be considered void from the beginning. This license to the Inventors is not assignable, although the license will pass to the heirs of an Inventor if that Inventor dies; the Inventors, individually or jointly, may appoint a representative who may act in their behalf in granting sublicenses under this section. Assignee acknowledges that the promises in section 2 and 4 are intended to benefit third parties, except in the case of an assertion of claims of the Patents authorized under section 2.

The parties are signing this agreement on the date stated in the introductory clause.
